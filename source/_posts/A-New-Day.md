Staring down moonlit corridor
Pine trees dressed in white
Snow crunches underfoot
Hesitant in my journey
The desire to continue is no longer there

It is the warm hearth of my notebook
that calls to me

In the distance they are waiting
It is my purpose to give them theirs
But it is the unwritten page I long for
A new romance of old desires

I can still see it
The glowing fire through the windows
of the nestled tavern that are
the bound pages of an enduring confidant
Where I can drink freely of my thoughts

The cresting sun
summons me to station
I pull my coat tight
to guard from cold burden of obligation
and start down the path of a new day
