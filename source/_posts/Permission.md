Go on and Do It
What are you waiting for
No one bars the way
No License need applied
No Duty taxed
No Permission need be granted
No Apprenticeship lobbied
Set sail in your endeavour
The Captain of the ship
Pay no mind of tariffs
Set by those who do not control the waters
Relish in the high waves of struggle
Before you find the calm seas of progress
You must navigate the storms of your ignorance
