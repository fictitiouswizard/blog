On this day I wander
In aimless pursuit of understanding
Released from the bonds of distance
My Travels are unrestrained by body
A vagabond apprentice
Exploring foreign wisdom
Searching myself for meaning
Finding only the unrelenting inquiry
of Curiosity
The Tyrant of my mind
Has made of me a neglectful student
Deciphering private conversations of trade
To betray newfound familiarity with abandonment
Bittersweet ignorance left behind
On this day I wander
