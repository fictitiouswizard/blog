Slow to muse and sluggish of wit
The Crow struggles to find the verse to his unwritten writ
Fearing his stage fleeting
Despairing the coming judgement of his complement
He pulls forth a solemn tome
Never one to lose initiative
The Hare put forth a wry smile
A hidden flick disclosing his roguish fancy
Dread sunders the work from the Crow's purchase
Now a latern burning bright for all to see
Foes aware the transgression
Now grasp they are not alone
With sufficient aberration announced
The Hare disperses into the shadow
To dance his revelry of blades
