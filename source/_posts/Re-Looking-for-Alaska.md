I have never read your book
but, its title often occupies my mind.
Three words that mean more to me than I fear
the contents hidden between its covers ever could.
Kept in view from my desk, I look back with fondness
on a past that never happened.

A friendship forgotten to time
that resides in the cold frontier of the north.
If only I was so bold to travel with him on that day
there would be no need to seek out our friendship in memory.
What can be said to a brother in companionship I failed.
Unable to admit that in time of need
I was too afraid to follow.
A childhood dream I betrayed.

On cool Arkansas fall nights,
I think of a wilderness which no airline fare could provide
and look toward Alaska.

I am sure your book is lovely.
I hope one day I open it.
